**Final Project**

To complete the cybersecurity bootcamp course, the final project was to act as a penetration tester and SOC analyst to exploit a vulnerable web server.

- Create alarms and thresholds in the Elasticsearch Watcher
- Use cyber kill chain to find vulnerabilities to exploit the vulnerable Wordpress site and server
- Analyze web traffic with Wireshark and find malicious activity on the servers
- Compile findings into a presentation to report on flaws, tips to mitigate risks and system hardening

This work was done as a team project but all findings and recommendations are solely of the author's.
